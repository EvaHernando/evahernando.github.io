                  <h2><strong> Senior Service Designer</strong></h2>
                  <h6> Fjord (DE)</h6>
        
        <p>I started at Fjord as a Service designer and become a                   Senior Service designer in December 2015. 

                        My work there involves identifying design opportunities, creating frameworks, and turning them into usable interactions and prototypes. I lead design-thinking workshops with clients. I participate in the scoping and planning of the project and the development of the relationship with the client. <br>  <br>
                        I am instrumental in the initial phases of a project from insights, to concept, by guiding how research can be conducted and distilled into actionable design directions and the ideation of service concepts. <br>  <br> 
                        I support major multinational clients on their new services and digital transformation journeys by emphasising a user-centred mindset to define their future customer experiences.<br> 
                        <br> During these years, I have had the chance to work in other Fjord studios and for clients in several countries.
