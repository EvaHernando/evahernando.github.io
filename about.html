        <p>Throughout the years at Fjord I have had the chance to work in many different types of projects and industries, seeing how the nature of projects evolved, becoming more complex and strategic. <br> <br> 
I have acquired a broad skill set that ranges from research to product delivery. My mission has always been to help clients on their digital transformation journeys by emphasising a user-centred mindset and having a holistic design and problem-solving approach.<br> <br>  
As a Service design lead, I support and drive the team in building quality outcomes from concept to delivery, giving the designers design direction and inspiring them to build their best work. <br> <br> 
I help clients to build a human-centered design mindset, to create delightful digital experiences and to rol out digital transformation strategies.<br> <br> 
I collaborate with the client to define needs and business objectives, to inform insightful concepts and create digital products, strategies, research studies or any other output that fits the needs of the project.
